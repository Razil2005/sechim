## üîß Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Deploy?
- **Check package.json**: Make sure it has the correct start script
- **Check logs**: Most platforms show deployment logs
- **File size**: Some platforms have limits (usually not an issue for this game)

### Players Can't Connect?
- **Share the correct URL**: Make sure you're sharing the deployed URL, not localhost
- **Room codes**: Make sure everyone is using the same 6-digit room code
- **Refresh**: Sometimes refreshing the page helps

### Performance Issues?
- **Free tiers have limits**: Upgrade if you have many concurrent players
- **Server sleeping**: Free servers may "sleep" - first access might be slower
