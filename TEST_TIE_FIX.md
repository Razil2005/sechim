# Tie Voting Fix - Test Documentation

## Problem Fixed
In the online multiplayer game, when votes were equal between two options, the selection was made randomly but users weren't informed that it was a random selection due to a tie.

## Solution Implemented

### Server-side Changes (server.js)
- Modified `endVoting()` method to track when there's a tie
- Added `isTie` boolean flag to the result object
- Now returns: `{ winnerIndex, winner, votes, isTie }`

### Client-side Changes (online-game.js)
- Updated `showVotingResult()` method to handle tie cases
- Shows different messages based on whether it was a tie:
  - **Normal win**: "[Winner] wins with X out of Y votes!"
  - **Tie case**: "It's a tie! [Winner] wins by random selection!"

## How to Test

1. Start the server: `node server.js`
2. Open two browser windows/tabs to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Create a room in one window, join with the other
4. Start a game and select a category
5. Have both players vote for different options (creating a tie)
6. End voting - you should now see: "It's a tie! [Winner] wins by random selection!"

## Before vs After

**Before**: Always showed "[Winner] wins with X total votes!" even for ties
**After**: Clearly indicates when a winner was chosen randomly due to a tie

## Note
The offline local multiplayer game (`game-logic.js`) already had this functionality working correctly.
